# Data Analyst Nanodegree
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program is comprised of 4 projects covering concepts in data analysis, practical statistics, data wrangling and data visualization. 

## [Investigate a Dataset Project](https://github.com/jessicarose00/udacity_nanodegree/blob/master/investigate_a_dataset/investigate-a-dataset.ipynb)
Using one of Udacity's curated datasets, I posed questions and used Numpy and Pandas to complete the entire data analysis process. I used Matplotlib to create visualizations and then communicated my findings.
