# Data Analyst Nanodegree
Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) is a 4-month online program comprised of 4 projects covering concepts in data analysis, practical statistics, data wrangling and data visualization. 

## [Investigate a Dataset Project](https://github.com/jessicarose00/udacity_nanodegree/blob/master/investigate_a_dataset/investigate-a-dataset.ipynb)
Using one of Udacity's curated datasets, I posed questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. This project uses Python libraries to work through a typical data analysis process. 

## [Analyze A/B Test Results](https://github.com/jessicarose00/udacity_nanodegree/blob/master/analyze_ab_test_results/analyze_ab_test_results.ipynb)
The goal of this project is to help an e-commerce company understand if they should implement a new page on their website, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data, then reported my conclusions and recommendations.

## [Wrangle and Analyze Data](https://github.com/jessicarose00/udacity_nanodegree/blob/master/wrangle_twitter_data/wrangle_act.ipynb)
This project involves gathering data in a variety of formats using several different methods, assessing its quality and tidiness, then cleaning it. I queried Twitter's API and combined scraped data with posts from the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. I addressed several data quality issues and produced visualizations to derive insights. 

## [Communicate Data Findings](https://github.com/jessicarose00/udacity_nanodegree/tree/master/communicate_data_findings)
In this project I utilized Python's visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. Then I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships.
